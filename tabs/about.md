Hi, thanks for stopping by! I am a Ph.D. in Economics with a specialization in Quantitative Finance. I mainly focused on developing statistical models for equity and fixed income products. My expertise includes the application of machine learning, data mining, large-scale panel data, and time series techniques to equity and fixed income products. Additionally, I have a keen interest in systematic trading strategies and algorithm development.

I am a driven individual with a strong desire to become a Quantitative Researcher in the fields of algo trading and algo research at a top-tier financial institution. Over the course of my career, I have acquired significant experience and expertise in quantitative modeling and algorithmic trading strategies for fixed income products, commodities, options, and credit derivatives.
